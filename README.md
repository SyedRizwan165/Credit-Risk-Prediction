# German Credit Data Analysis and Prediction

This project involves a comprehensive analysis of the German credit data set and the development of machine learning models to predict the risk of approving credit for loan applicants. The project covers the following key aspects:

## Data Exploration

- Performed exploratory data analysis to understand the data distribution, handle missing values, and identify potential correlations between features and the target variable (credit risk).
- Utilized various visualization techniques, such as histograms, box plots, and bar charts, to gain insights into the data.

## Feature Selection

- Applied statistical techniques like ANOVA (Analysis of Variance) and Chi-Square tests to identify the most relevant features for predicting credit risk.
- Selected the optimal set of features based on their significance and correlation with the target variable.

## Data Preprocessing

- Handled categorical variables by encoding them using techniques like one-hot encoding and label encoding.
- Performed data scaling and normalization to ensure consistent feature ranges.

## Machine Learning Models

- Implemented and evaluated various machine learning algorithms, including Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Trees, Random Forests, XGBoost, and AdaBoost.
- Performed model tuning and hyperparameter optimization to improve predictive performance.
- Utilized cross-validation techniques to estimate the generalization performance of the models.

## Model Evaluation

- Assessed the performance of the trained models using appropriate evaluation metrics, such as precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy.
- Analyzed the confusion matrices and generated classification reports for each model.
- Compared the performance of different models and selected the best-performing one for credit risk prediction.

## Technologies and Libraries

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- XGBoost

This project showcases my skills in data analysis, feature engineering, model building, and model evaluation for a binary classification problem. The insights gained from this analysis can be valuable for financial institutions or lenders in making informed decisions about credit risk assessments.
